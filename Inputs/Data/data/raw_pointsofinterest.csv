The river and surrounding lands are the traditional territory of many First Nations peoples, who have been using this waterway and the surrounding land for 12,000 years to fish, hunt, travel and establish settlements. The Mississaugas called the river Kabechenong, meaning 'gathering place to tie up.' When Europeans first colonized the area, it was known as the Toronto River or St. John's River. In 1793, Upper Canada's first Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe named it Humber, after the mouth of a large river near his family estate in England. In the following centuries, European colonists established roads and bridges, milling industries, dams and retaining walls. Many of these developments and their impacts on the natural river can be seen today. The Humber River originates on the Niagara Escarpment and the Oak Ridges Moraine and flows south into Lake Ontario. The main body of water runs 126 kilometres, where it then branches in two directions. The eastern branch flows 63 kilometres and the west branch flows   45 kilometres. However, the Humber River connects to approximately 750 creeks and tributaries north of the city. The Humber River and its banks are rich with wildlife and plant life. To date, 918 plant species have been identified, along with 143 birds, 30 mammals and 61 species of fish. Along the river, there are currently more than 1,200 potential in-stream barriers, including elevated culverts, dams, weirs and watercourse crossings.

However, since the arrival of Euro-Canadian settlers just two centuries ago, it has been significantly altered by local landowners and major City initiatives in efforts to harness this natural resource. From the 1880s to early 1900s, City Council established initiatives to straighten and widen the river below Gerrard Street East, opening up land for developments such as railways and the Don Valley Parkway, and addressing run-off that was polluting the Don River waters. Despite earlier efforts, pollution, erosion and flooding continued to be a problem throughout the 1900s. To address this, the Don Valley has undergone one of the largest regeneration projects in the world. Initiated in the late 1980s, this effort has seen the restoration of native plant species, wetlands and the establishment of recreational trails, with the help of community groups such as the Todmorden Wildlife Preserve and the Don Watershed Regeneration Council.

From the 1930s they were all gardeners of Chinese origin, with the last Chinese gardeners being Joe and Lillie Chung from 1942 to 1944. The Chungs' son, Willie, remembers that they grew cabbages, celery and tomatoes and delivered them by truck to sell at the St. Lawrence Market.

The farmlands on Eglinton Avenue from Victoria Park Avenue eastwards were soon transformed into the Golden Mile industrial complex. To attract businesses during Canadas post-war economic boom, the land was offered at inexpensive prices and low property taxes. Since then, the Golden Mile attracted a range of major companies, including Delco, Thermos, Frigidaire, and car manufacturers like General Motors and Volkswagen. In 1954, the Golden Mile Plaza opened at Victoria Park Avenue and Eglinton Avenue East, becoming the largest shopping centre in Canada at the time. In 1959, the Golden Mile Plaza was even visited by Queen Elizabeth II. While the area was booming for a number of decades, many of these industries have moved out since the 1980s.
